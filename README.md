Structural Dynamics with Python

This repository contains the course material for the "High-speed Image Based Experimental Modal Analysis &amp; Open Source Tools" online course.


# How to follow the course

The course material is organised into two interactive Notebooks, where the participants can actively follow the instructors' examples, as well as explore the provided source code.

In this repository, a [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) template is provided for each planned activity. These are interactive documents, that contain useful information and written instructions, as well as runnable source code for the examples provided by the instructors.

These templates should be [downloaded](#download) to your machine prior to the courses, where they will serve as a guide for our work, as well as a convenient way for you to take notes.
